A survey of the most common ectoparasites of mammals and birds was made in the Zaria area of Nigeria covering a dry season and a rainy season in 1977-78. Of 320 dogs examined, 108 were infested. The parasites and (in brackets) the number of dogs infested were as follows: Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latr.) (64), Haemaphysalis leachii leachii (Aud.) (17), Ctenocephalides felis strongylus (Jordan) (5), Cordylobia anthropophaga (Blanch. & Bérenger-Féraud) (5), Cheyletiella yasguri Smiley (3), Linognathus setosus (Olf.) (1), Otodectes cynotis (Her.) (3) and Sarcoptes scabiei (L.) (3). Of 150 rabbits, 38 were infested with Psoroptes cuniculi (Delafond) (communis cuniculi), and of 30 horses, 1 was infested with an unidentified species of Psoroptes. Of 300 birds (mainly chickens) examined, 199 were infested, as follows: Menacanthus stramineus (Nitzsch) (128), Dermanyssus gallinae (Deg.) (60), Goniodes gigas (Tasch.) (10), Haemaphysalis hoodi hoodi Warb. & Nutt. (1) and Argas persicus (Oken).",0,"Nosa","Unclear","Agbede, RIS;","A survey of ectoparasites and ectoparasitic conditions of animals in Zaria, Nigeria.",NA,NA,"NULL","NULL",1981,NA,"Cannot access an part of the paper",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,7.6914,11.1306
